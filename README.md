 Gorillaz is a virtual band created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998. 
 
 This site is build to advertise the bands albums, history and some of their sketches, as well as to publicise their ability to perform to events such as private

    2. The fields "Your Name" , "Your Telephone" and "Your Email" are required in order to submit succesfully your form.
    3. The field "Message Subject" it's not mandatory , which means you'll be able to send your message.
