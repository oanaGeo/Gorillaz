                    <p>Stuart Harold "2-D" Pot (born 23 May 1978) is a fictional English musician and member of the British virtual band Gorillaz. He provides the lead vocals and plays the keyboard for the band. 2-D's singing voice is provided by Blur frontman Damon Albarn on Gorillaz' recordings and performances, while in additional material, his speaking voice is provided by actor Nelson De Freitas.<br>The character 2-D sings and plays the keyboard. He can play guitar, as can Murdoc, but both leave it to Noodle. In most cases, 2-D's singing voice is much lower than his warbly speaking voice. His vocal range is very wide, and he has sung everything from baritone to falsetto. All his singing voices are provided by Damon Albarn, including the spoken verses in the 2005 hit "Feel Good Inc." 2-D apparently has had some influence in the lyric-writing process (as evidenced by the credits on the insert of the titular debut album) even though his intelligence is reputedly negligible. Apparently, Murdoc has had Albarn teach 2-D from time to time to sing better than he already could, and apparently even sing in some of their songs, as stated in an NME interview with Albarn.

                    <p>Russel Hobbs is a fictional American musician, and member of the British virtual band Gorillaz. He provides the drums and percussion for the band. Like all the other Gorillaz band members, he was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998. Russel's spoken voice is supplied by Remi Kabaka Jr.<br>Like all of the other Gorillaz members, Russel was not based on a real person, but was instead conceptualised by Hewlett and Albarn as the personification of the hip hop aspect of Gorillaz music, to embody the spirit of collaboration with various rappers.</p><br>

                    <p>Noodle (born 31 October 1990) is a fictional Japanese musician, singer, and member of the British virtual band Gorillaz. She provides the lead guitar, as well as some occasional lead and backing vocals for the band.<br>Like all other band members of Gorillaz, she was created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Noodle has been voiced by Japanese actress Haruka Kuroda and singer-songwriter Miho Hatori of trip-hop group Cibo Matto.<br>When first conceptualising the depiction of a guitarist for Gorillaz, Hewlett was initially considering depicting her as a 17-year-old adolescent girl carrying guitars, but Albarn noted that the idea was too similar to what Hewlett usually draws and suggested that Hewlett should create "something different". Taking Albarn's advice, Hewlett came up with the first official Noodle, a 10-year-old Japanese girl. Later, Hewlett drew her as 13 years old, and since then, he said she has aged further.</p><br>

He is voiced by Phil Cornwell, and was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett.<br>Hewlett, in an interview with The Guardian, has said that he made the character responsible for most of the conception and formation of Gorillaz, and that the character is supposed to be angry that the 2D character is the frontman of the band. Aspects of Murdoc's appearance and personality were based on that of a young Keith Richards.</p><br>

                    <p>Damon Albarn OBE (born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, best known as the lead singer of the British rock band Blur as well as the co-founder, lead vocalist, instrumentalist, and principal songwriter of the virtual band Gorillaz.<br>Raised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met guitarist Graham Coxon and formed Blur, which released its debut album Leisure in 1991. After spending long periods touring the U.S., Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis. Subsequent albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999), and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.</p><br>
