                        <h1>GORILLAZ</h1>
                        <p>Gorillaz are a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band primarily consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards) Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, occasional vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through music videos, interviews, and other short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, and often collaborates with other musicians.</p><br><br>
                        <h1>A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY</h1>
                        <p>Musician Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.</p>

                    2-D was loosely inspired by a friend of Hewlett and Albarn's who had worked with both Gorillaz and Blur.<br><br>
                    Stuart Pot was born on 23 May 1978 to David and Rachel Pot. His father works as a mechanic and a fairgrounds worker, while his mother works as a nurse. He was born in Crawley, West Sussex, England, and attended St Wilfrid's Catholic School. When he was 11 years old, Stuart was involved in an accident where he fell from a tree and hit his head. This caused all his natural brown hair to shed, until it eventually grew back in a deep azure blue color. The accident also caused him to experience frequent migraines, for which his mother supplied him with painkillers.<br><br>
                    At age 19, Stuart was hit in the face by Murdoc Niccals when he crashed his Vauxhall Astra into Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium, in an attempt to raid the store of its musical equipment. This caused Stuart to receive hyphema in his left eye and put him into a coma. Murdoc was then arrested and sentenced to 30,000 hours of community service, as well as to care for the vegetabilised Stuart for 10 hours a week. Not long after, Murdoc injured Stuart again while pulling off 360 donuts to impress a small crowd of women. Stuart came crashing through the windshield of the car, and fractured his other eye. After the incident, he woke up from his vegetative state and was given the nickname "2-D", which refers to the two dents in his head.<br><br>
                    <strong>Role as musician</strong><br>
                    The character 2-D sings and plays the keyboard. He can play guitar, as can Murdoc, but both leave it to Noodle. In most cases, 2-D's singing voice is much lower than his warbly speaking voice. His vocal range is very wide, and he has sung everything from baritone to falsetto. All his singing voices are provided by Damon Albarn, including the spoken verses in the 2005 hit "Feel Good Inc." 2-D apparently has had some influence in the lyric-writing process (as evidenced by the credits on the insert of the titular debut album) even though his intelligence is reputedly negligible. Apparently, Murdoc has had Albarn teach 2-D from time to time to sing better than he already could, and apparently even sing in some of their songs, as stated in an NME interview with Albarn.

                    Like all of the other Gorillaz members, Russel was not based on a real person, but was instead conceptualised by Hewlett and Albarn as the personification of the hip hop aspect of Gorillaz music, to embody the spirit of collaboration with various rappers.<br><br>
                    Russel Hobbs provides the percussion for Gorillaz, and he can invoke the souls of dead rappers from the fictional hip hop canon. On the debut Gorillaz album, Russel called upon and embodied the soul of "Del tha Ghost Rapper", a character voiced by and loosely based on American rapper Del the Funky Homosapien. This came about when Russel was a teenager, part of the hip hop scene. His friends were rappers; unfortunately this changed when a drive-by shooting happened, and he was the only survivor. After that event, all of his friends who were killed possessed his body, making his eyes completely white, and making him amazingly skilled at playing music.

                    <strong>Characterization</strong><br><br>
                    When first conceptualising the depiction of a guitarist for Gorillaz, Hewlett was initially considering depicting her as a 17-year-old adolescent girl carrying guitars, but Albarn noted that the idea was too similar to what Hewlett usually draws and suggested that Hewlett should create "something different". Taking Albarn's advice, Hewlett came up with the first official Noodle, a 10-year-old Japanese girl. Later, Hewlett drew her as 13 years old, and since then, he said she has aged further.<br><br>
                    <strong>Fictional history</strong><br>
                    Noodle first came to the Gorillaz when they were a trio (composed of 2-D, Murdoc and Russel) after their original guitarist and 2D's girlfriend Paula Cracker was caught having sex with Murdoc in the toilets of Kong Studios, which resulted in her being thrown out of the band. As a result, the band was left needing a guitarist, so they ran an ad looking for one. The next day, a FedEx crate arrived at Kong Studios, and a little Asian girl popped out and started playing on her guitar, as 2-D later described it, "The riff to end all riffs". After shredding on her guitar, she spoke a single word to the trio, and it became her nickname: "Noodle".<br><br>
                    In 2003 Noodle visited Japan in an attempt to discover her past after being haunted by disturbing nightmares while on tour. While in a restaurant, she regained her lost memory after hearing the words 'ocean bacon'. She coincidentally met with her mentor, Mr. Kyuzo, who was working as the head chef in the restaurant. Kyuzo helped her make sense of her lost memories: Noodle is, in fact, part of a secret government super soldier project, trained specially as a musician. As a result, she is a master of many weapons, languages, and musical instruments, with a specialty in the guitar, both as a musical instrument, and a weapon. Out of the 23 children created for the project, Noodle was the only one to survive; the others were all destroyed by the government when the project was scrapped.

                    Hewlett, in an interview with The Guardian, has said that he made the character responsible for most of the conception and formation of Gorillaz, and that the character is supposed to be angry that the 2D character is the frontman of the band. Aspects of Murdoc's appearance and personality were based on that of a young Keith Richards.<br><br>
                    At the Brit Awards 2018, Murdoc was incarcerated. He was not involved in Gorillaz sixth album, The Now Now, and was temporarily replaced by Ace. From 4 June to 26 October 2018, the band ran a bi-weekly text-adventure ARG called Free Murdoc, in which the player assists Murdoc as he attempts to escape from prison. Murdoc was reunited with the band on 20 September, in time to join them on the final leg of The Now Now Tour. Murdoc is featured in Mission 101, a monthly web-series produced by Gorillaz in late 2018 to promote their limited edition line of G-Shock watches.

                    Raised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met guitarist Graham Coxon and formed Blur, which released its debut album Leisure in 1991. After spending long periods touring the U.S., Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis. Subsequent albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999), and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.<br><br>
                    Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from alternative rock, trip hop, hip hop, electronica, dub, reggae and pop, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning successful follow-ups Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach, The Fall (both released in 2010), Humanz (2017), and The Now Now (2018). Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, Gorillaz albums typically feature collaborations from a range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "Most Successful Virtual Band".<br><br>
                    Albarn's other projects include two supergroups: the Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon as well as working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam and composing film soundtracks. He has also scored stage productions, namely Monkey: Journey to the West (2008), Dr Dee (2012) and Wonder.land (2016). His debut solo studio album Everyday Robots was released in 2014.<br><br>
                    In 2008, The Daily Telegraph ranked Albarn number 18 in their list of the "100 most powerful people in British culture". In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music.

                    Brought up in Horsham, West Sussex, Jamie Hewlett was a pupil at Tanbridge House School, a local co-educational comprehensive for pupils aged 11–16 years. He contributed to the art work of a road safety campaign that ended up runner-up in a national television competition.<br><br>
                    By 1992, Hewlett had become a major creator in the comics industry, and one of the few to break into mainstream media. He had worked with writer Peter Milligan on Hewligan's Haircut in 2000 AD issues 700 to 707. The series was later compiled into a trade paperback. He was also involved in providing covers and art for Shade, the Changing Man, also written by Milligan for DC Comics.<br><br>
                    Tank Girl was also optioned to be made into a film by MGM after being considered by, among others, Steven Spielberg. The film was released in 1995 and featured Lori Petty as Tank Girl. It was a commercial and critical failure and was criticised by fans who said it failed to capture the essence of the original strip. Hewlett had very little involvement with the film.<br><br>
                    He also drew a Tank Girl mini-series for the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics written by Peter Milligan.<br><br>
                    In January 2006, Hewlett's artwork for Gorillaz was shortlisted for the Design Museum's Designer of the Year award. In May 2006, Jamie Hewlett was named the Designer of the Year 2006. On 25 May 2006, both Hewlett and Albarn won the joint award for Songwriters of the Year at the Ivor Novello Awards.<br><br>
                    In 2007, Hewlett and Albarn premiered their first major work since Gorillaz, entitled Monkey: Journey to the West, a re-working of the ancient Chinese legend Journey to the West. Albarn wrote the score whilst Hewlett designed the set, animations and costumes. Written and adapted by Chen Shi-zheng, the show featured 45 Chinese circus acrobats, Shaolin monks and Chinese vocalists. It premiered at the Palace Theatre, Manchester as part of the Manchester International Festival, on 28 June 2007.
